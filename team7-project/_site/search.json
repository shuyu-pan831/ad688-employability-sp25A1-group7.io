    "text": "Research & Literature Review\nThe Role of Monetary Policy in Economic Growth\nThe literature on monetary policy and economic growth highlights the crucial role of central banks in influencing macroeconomic stability. Research emphasizes various transmission mechanisms, including interest rates, credit supply, and market expectations, through which policy decisions impact investment, consumption, and overall economic performance. Studies also explore the varying effectiveness of monetary policies across different economic contexts, with factors such as financial market development and institutional credibility playing a significant role. However, implementing monetary policy is not without challenges. Scholars discuss issues such as time lags in policy effects, constraints like the zero-lower bound on interest rates, and trade-offs between inflation control and economic expansion. The existing research underscores the complexity of monetary policy, suggesting that its success depends on well-calibrated, context-specific strategies to balance economic growth and stability.\nData Analytics Skills and Industry Expectations\nThe literature on data analytics skills and industry expectations highlights the growing demand for professionals who possess a mix of technical and soft skills to meet market needs. The study in the Information Systems Education Journal (ISEDJ) (2024) analyzes 786 job postings to identify the most sought-after competencies for data analytics positions. The findings indicate that soft skills, particularly communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, dominate employer preferences, with 11 out of the top 21 desired skills falling under this category. In addition, domain-related skills, such as data visualization, data cleaning, and data extraction, are critical, along with programming knowledge in languages like Python and SQL. This suggests that higher education curricula must evolve to balance technical and interpersonal skill development to enhance graduate employability. Prior research supports this perspective, emphasizing that university programs must align with industry expectations to ensure strong career placement for graduates. Studies have traditionally used job postings as a key method to analyze shifting industry demands, demonstrating an increasing focus on data analysis, statistical modeling, and AI-driven techniques (Brooks et al., 2018). Additionally, the literature stresses the importance of continuous skill adaptation, as new trends, such as automation and AI integration, reshape employer requirements (Davenport & Harris, 2007). As industries generate vast amounts of data, projected to reach 181 zettabytes by 2025, the ability to manage and extract insights from this data becomes a crucial competency. This reinforces the need for dynamic, industry-relevant educational programs that equip students with both technical expertise and essential workplace competencies.\nForecast evaluation for data scientists: common pitfalls and best practices\nThe literature on forecast evaluation for data scientists highlights the growing use of machine learning and deep learning techniques in time-series forecasting. While these models offer powerful predictive capabilities, their evaluation often lacks the rigor of traditional statistical methods. Many machine learning researchers adopt flawed evaluation practices, leading to misleading conclusions about model performance. Key challenges include dealing with non-stationarities in time-series data, selecting appropriate validation strategies, and ensuring that error measures accurately reflect forecasting accuracy. Studies emphasize that improper benchmarking, such as using inadequate comparison models or inappropriate error metrics like MAPE on small-value datasets, can distort results and overstate the effectiveness of certain methods.\nTo improve forecast evaluation, recent research advocates for more structured methodologies that align with best practices in both machine learning and traditional econometrics. Choosing appropriate data partitioning techniques, selecting meaningful error measures, and benchmarking against simple yet robust models like the naïve forecast are critical steps in ensuring reliable performance assessment. Additionally, industry-specific considerations, such as the high volatility of financial and energy sector data, further complicate evaluation methods. The lack of universally accepted standards has led to inconsistencies in published research, reinforcing the need to bridge the gap between machine learning and classical forecasting principles to enhance model evaluation and reliability."
